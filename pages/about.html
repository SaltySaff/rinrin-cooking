                    <p>
                        I am a third-generation Taiwanese, born and raised in Kobe, Japan.
                        I attended international schools from kindergarten, including Stella Maris and Canadian Academy, and later graduated from Boston University with a major in international relations.
                        Fluent in English, Japanese, and easy Chinese, I am the mother of two daughters and have 25 years of experience teaching English in Yokohama, Japan.
                        My teaching experience ranges from toddlers to adults in various settings, including homes, community centers, nurseries, elementary schools, and junior high schools. 
                        I incorporate a fun and game-style curriculum and have recently added elements of Taiwanese, Chinese, and Japanese cooking to my lessons. In my free time, I enjoy eating, cooking, chatting, and singing.
